<p>Math:I love math but I propose that geometry should not be considered math. It angers me thinking people even like such a class. Because i dont like it, it shouldn't be a subjext. End of discussion.</p>
<p>Reading:I excel in reading when my brain feels like it. Poems make my squishy brain melt or short circuit. Why do people even love those things. Just read a book, they're wonderful. You may argue that rap songs, etc. are poenms, but...No, because I said so.</p>
<p>Science:The worst yet slightly intriguing subject. Sometimes it's good other times not so muc. It depends on how i'm feeling, how my teacher is feeling, and if it's a full moon. </p>
<p>IT honors: Im not surviving. Hanging by a thread.</p>
